    <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting<br>
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy<br>
        text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley<br>
        of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has<br>
        survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic<br>
        typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in<br>
        the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem<br>
        Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing<br>
        software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
